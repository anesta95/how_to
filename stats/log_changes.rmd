# Log Transformations


## `log(x+1)` Data Transformation

[Why?](https://onbiostatistics.blogspot.com/2012/05/logx1-data-transformation.html)

When performing data analysis, sometimes the data is skewed and not normally-distributed and a data transformation is needed.

The `log(x + 1)` or `log(x + 0.001)`, or `log(x + 0.00001)`, and so on are ways to adjust for variables with that have zero values that you want to adjust to be normally distributed and include in the log-transformation.
