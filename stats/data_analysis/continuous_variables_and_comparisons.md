When presenting data, the best choice of chart depends on the comparison you want your audience to make.

Use **bar charts** to compare values with each other.
Use **pie charts** to compare one value against the total.

### Histograms
When we put continuous variables into categories, the categories should be the same width â€” this turns our bar chart into a **histogram**. 

If we make the bins on a histogram too narrow, the number in each category gets small, and random chance plays a larger role.

By adding more data to a histogram we see the shape become smoother and can draw more reliable conclusions about the distribution of the continous variable.

A bar chart is the best choice for comparing categorical variables. Pie charts are good for seeing a quantity as a proportion of the total, while histograms are used for continuous variables.
