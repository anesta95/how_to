### Filtering Data
In typical English we often use “or” when only one option should be true, but a logical `OR` is true even if both statements are true.

Filters can use logical expressions based on inequalities like $\lt$ (less than) or $\geq$ (greater than or equal to). Each of these relationships functions similar to the English language definition. 

| Symbol  | Meaning  |
|---|---|
| =  | Equal to  |
| $\neq$  | Not equal to  |
| $\gt$  | Greater than  |
| $\geq$  | Greater than or equal to  |
| $\lt$  | Less than  |
| $\leq$  | Less than or equal to  |

### Transforming Data
The **relative change** between two values is the ratio resulting from dividing the absolute change (new value - old value) by the old value. This is also the _percent change_
