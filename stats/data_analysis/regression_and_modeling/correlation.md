## Correlations

By quantifying relationships between measurements, we can use one measurement to predict another. **Correlation** quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between two measurements.

## Computing correlations

When correlation is closer to $1$, the points on the scatter plot show a stronger linear relationship, making unknown measurements easier to predict. When correlation is closer to $0$, the points are more spread out, making measurements less predictable. 

As correlation drops below zero and approaches $-1$, the points on the scatter plot begin to form a line that points down from left to right. A **negative correlation** indicates that as one measurement increases, the other tends to decrease. As negative correlation values come closer to $−1$, the relationship between the two measurements becomes stronger. 

When correlation is equal to $1$ or $−1$, two measurements are mathematically related or identical. This is called perfect correlation, and rarely occurs naturally.

A correlation of $0$ indicates that the two measurements analyzed do not have a linear relationship.
