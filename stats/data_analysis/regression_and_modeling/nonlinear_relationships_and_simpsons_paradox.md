Correlation has the same limitation as linear regression â€“ it quantifies the strength of a **linear** relationship. If the relationship is nonlinear, correlation is likely to be misleading.

As the relationship between two variables plotted on a scatter plot becomes more nonlinear, the slope of the regression line and $R^2$ approach $0$. In other nonlinear relationships, the slope is not always $0$, but it is generally not a good representation of the relationship.

If correlation is close to $0$, we can conclude that there is no _linear_ relationship, but there could still be a **nonlinear** relationship. The best way to tell if there is a nonlinear relationship is to look at the scatter plot.

**Simpson's paradox** describes the effect of combining groups of data, causing the individual trends of these groups to possibly reverse or disappear. In general, when we combine dissimilar groups, correlation and regression can be misleading.
