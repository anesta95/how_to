**Independent variables** $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ are measured directly to understand their impact on the **dependent variable** (y).

A **mathematical model** describes a real-world phenomenon in mathematical language. Commonly in simple linear regression it's expressed with the equation $y = mx + b$. Where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $m$ is the slope of the line-of-best-fit/regression line and $b$ is the y-intercept on a scatterplot of the regression line. One way to improve a model is by including another _independent_ variable.

**Multiple linear regression** is an extension of simple linear regression that uses more than one independent variable. With _multiple linear regression_, we can express the dependent variable _y_ in terms of independent variables $x_1, x_2, \dots$ as:

$y = a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots$
