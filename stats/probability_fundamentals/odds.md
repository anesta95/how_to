Odds have a simple relationship with probability. When probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, the relationship between probability $p$ and odds $t$ are:

$t = \frac{p}{1 - p}$
$p = \frac{t}{1 + t}$

When probability is expressed as a percentage, it must be divided by 100 before using these formulas.

When the odds have value $t$, one often says "$t$ to 1" or writes "$t$:1". If the value $t$ can be written as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ then one can say "$p$ to $q$" or write "$p$:$q$".

* Probability or risk = $\frac{p}{p+q}$
* Odds = $p:q$

Where $p$ is the number of times in a probability set that an event _does_ happen and $q$ is the number of times the same event _doesn't_ happen. Rolling any number in a fair six-sided die will have a $p$ value of 1 and a $q$ value of 5. So the **probability** of rolling any given number of a fair six sided die is $\frac{1}{6}$ or $16.\bar{6}%$ while the **odds** are $1:5$

### Six-sided die example

The odds of rolling a 6 on a six-sided die is "1 to 5" or "1:5". This is because there is 1 event (rolling a 6) that produces the specified outcome, and 5 events that do not (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). The odds of rolling either a 5 _or_ 6 is 2:4. This is because there are 2 events (rolling a 5 or 6) that produce the specified outcome, and 4 events that do not (rolling a 1, 2, 3 or 4). The odds of **not** rolling a 5 or 6 is the inverse 4:2. This is because there are 4 events that produce the specified outcome of "not rolling a 5 or 6" (rolling a 1, 2, 3 or 4) and two that do not (rolling a 5 or 6).

The probability of an event is different, but related, and can be calculated from the odds, and vice versa. The probability of rolling a 5 or 6 is the fraction of the number of events over total events or 2/(2+4), which is 1/3 or approximately 0.33 or 33%.

When gambling, odds are often given as the ratio of the possible net profit to the possible net loss. Typically you pay the possible loss ("stake" or "wager") up front and, if you win, you are paid the net win plus you also get your stake returned. So wagering 1 at 5:1, which is called "5 to 1", pays out 5 + 1 = 6, which is called "6 for 1". (If you make 6 wagers of 1, and win once and lose 5 times, you will be paid 6 and finish square.) Wagering 1 at 1:1 (Evens, "1 to 1") pays out 1 + 1 = 2 ("2 for 1") and wagering 2 at 1:2 ("1 to 2") pays out 1 + 2 = 3 ("3 for 2").

Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.

* When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4:1 would be quoted as +400.
* When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome that is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1:4 would be quoted as âˆ’400.
