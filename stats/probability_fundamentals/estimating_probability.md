Probability lets us estimate the likelihood of an event based on the information available to us. Whenever we make a probability estimate but gain new information about the event afterwords, we should be willing to change it based on new information that seems relevant. 

The probability estimate is the percentage of simulations that produced a particular outcome. For example, in the English Premier League if you picked a match at random from games played in the $2021 - 22$ season, the probability that the home team won is simply the proportion of home wins in the season. In this case that's $\frac{163}{380} = 43\% = .43$ which can be called $P(Home\:Win)$ in mathematical notation.

Probabilities can be expressed as a percentage like $43\%$ or as a decimal, like $0.43$.

But what about a match that hasn’t happened yet? Can we still say that the probability of the home team winning is $0.43$?

$0.43$ would be a reasonable estimate, as long as we recognize that we are making an assumption:

**The future will behave like the past.**

If the average proportion of games won by the home team has not changed over time, we can get a more reliable estimate by using data from more years, since this will reduce the effect of random variation. As long as we don’t think anything important has changed, using more data should give us a more accurate prediction of the future. 

_However..._
More data does not always lead to a better probability estimate. If something _has_ changed in the data, older data will be less relevant and skew our estimates. For example, to predict a team's winning percentage for an upcoming season, it wouldn't make much sense to use old data from when it had different players and wasn't as talented/or was much more talented if that had changed substantively from the past to the present.

Using more data typically gives more reliable predictions, but when the situation changes, past data can be misleading.
