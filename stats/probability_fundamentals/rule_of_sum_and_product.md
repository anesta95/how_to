Although probability deals with chance events, it rests on a few precise mathematical rules. Used correctly, these rules unlock a wealth of information about random occurrences.

The **rule of sum** explains how to find the probability that _at least one of two events occurs_. When two events are **mutually exclusive** – meaning they can never occur simultaneously – the rule of sum is simply:

$P(A\:or\:B) = P(A) + P(B)$

Two events are **independent** if the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event. As an example, the results of distinct coin flips are _independent_ events. However, the results of drawing distinct cards from the deck are _dependent_, assuming the cards are not added back to the deck after being drawn. After the first card is drawn from a deck, there are fewer cards in the deck. So, the outcome of the first card affects the probability of drawing other cards from the deck because there are fewer possible outcomes.

The **rule of product** explains how to find the probability that _all_ events occur when the events are _independent_. Specifically:

$P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)$
