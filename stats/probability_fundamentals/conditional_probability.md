A conditional probability is a probability of `x` _given_ `y`. For example the probability that the home team will win in a soccer match _given_ that they are trailing at half time. It is calculated like this:

$\frac{P(x\:and\:y)}{P(y)}$

The symbol `|` is used to mean "given" in mathematical notation. $P(A|B)$ or $P(A\:given\:B)$, is the probability of $A$ happening when $B$ has already happened. 

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\:and\:B)}{P(B)}$
