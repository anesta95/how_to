The **rule of product** explains how to find the probability that all events occur when the events are _independent_. Specifically $P(A\:and\:B) = P(A) * P(B)$

Two events are **independent** when the probability of one occurring has no effect on the probability of the other occurring.

The rule of sum explains how to find the probability that at least one of two events occurs. When two events are **mutually exclusive**, meaning that they can never occur simultaneously, the rule of sum is simply:

$P(A\:or\:B) = P(A) + P(B)$
