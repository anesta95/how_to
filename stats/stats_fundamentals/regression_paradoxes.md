A **lurking variable** is a variable that is not included as an explanatory or response variable in the analysis but can affect the interpretation of relationships between variables.

Let **reliability** measure the consistency of performance from 0%, completely random, to 100%, completely consistent.

**Estimated ability** via Kelley's equation is:

`ability = (reliability)(score) + (1 - reliability)(average group score)`

We can think of ability as the “true score” a person should attain on a test given that it was taken under optimal circumstances.

Let's imagine that we have a Sports Illustrated cover feature who is a baseball player with a current batting average of 0.357.

Suppose the MLB batting average is 0.255 and the year-to-year correlation for batting average is 0.41.

What is the estimated ability of the cover feature player?

`(0.41, the "reliability" score a.k.a the year-to-year correlation)(0.357, the player's score) + (0.59, 1 minus the reliability score)(0.255, the league average) = 0.297`

The player's batting average is currently far above the mean, but taking regression to the mean into account, we would expect his score to still be above, but closer to the group average.
