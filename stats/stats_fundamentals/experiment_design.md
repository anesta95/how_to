In experiments, it is crucial to control for **lurking variables** – a variable that isn't included as an explanatory or response factor in the analysis, but still has the potential to alter the understanding of relationships between variables – as thoroughly as possible.

These lurking variables can be managed through **blocking**, which involves grouping similar experimental units, or by controlling other random factors present in the scenario.

The ultimate objective is to design an experiment in which the single difference between the experimental units is the treatment under investigation.

As it is typically impractical to gather measurements from every individual of interest, one key objective in experimental design is to guarantee that our sample is **representative** of the population of interest. 

The standard method for selecting subjects for a sample is known as **simple random sampling**, in which the group for study is randomly selected from the larger population. However, this approach may not always be feasible or the best choice.

A study that is **double-blind** is one in which not only are the participants unaware of the treatment or intervention they are receiving — hence, blind — but also the researchers themselves are uninformed about which treatment each participant is assigned to.

Confounding happens whenever a treatment is correlated with other effects or influences. When this takes place, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the effects of our treatment and the confounding influences. If the confounding is substantial enough, it can render our experiments invalid. The critical point to understand is that when our treatment is confounded with another variable, we can't separate the effects or know how much each contributed.

### A real-world example...

Several studies have indicated that children with a higher birth order number are more likely to have Down's syndrome. Birth order refers to the ranking of a child in relation to their siblings — thus, a fourth child has a higher birth order number than a first-born child.

Q: With what other variable are these studies most likely to be confounded?
A: The mother's age

The issue concerning birth order and Down's syndrome was confounded by its relation to the mother's age. In resolving this, we explored how categorizing the mothers by age prior to conducting our analysis could eliminate the influence of the confounding variable. This constitutes an instance of **blocking** — segmenting our experimental subjects into groups before initiating treatment and analysis in order to mitigate the impact of confounding variables.

**Blocking** allows us to reduce the impact of known confounding variables on our experiments by separating the subjects into groups. We usually choose to block when we believe that our subjects differ in some way that influences our measurement, or when we suspect that our treatment will affect different groups of subjects differently. _Blocking_ does reduce the size of each experiment, since each group must be considered individually.

**Simple random sampling** is often the simplest approach to sampling from a population. For instance, in a high school, simple random sampling could involve randomly selecting a set number of students from the entire student body.

**Stratified random sampling** involves first dividing the population into groups, and then selecting a random — but proportional — sample from each group.

A sample taken from a small group, which we believe to be representative of the larger population, is termed a **cluster sample**. While a cluster sample will yield a representative sample as long as the clusters resonate with the overall population, it is generally not possible to guarantee this. Therefore, a cluster sample, although often simpler to gather, introduces a certain degree of bias risk. 

**Systematic sampling** involves selecting a set interval for sampling from a list that contains the population, as opposed to using a simple random sample. However these factors are important to incorporate to help prevent systematic sampling from becoming biased:

* Choosing the starting position of the systematic sampling at random
* Ensuring that our systematic sample covers as much of the list as possible
