The difference between **observations** and **experiments** is very important in statistics. Whether we are using observational data or experimental data changes how we interpret conclusions. 

In order to make valid conclusions about the entire population, it is necessary to design an experiment that enables one to observe the population as a whole.

An _observation_ refers to the recording of a specific value at a given moment in time. Observations refer to the collection of data from past or present events without any human intervention. An example of this is survey data, where a researcher poses a series of questions. Observations are not confined to numerical values. An __observational study__ encompasses the collection of numerous observations that the investigators deem valuable to examine.

In contrast, an __experiment__ entails the deliberate application of specific treatments or interventions to specific groups, followed by the observation of specific values or outcomes. Experiments involve the direct or indirect manipulation of the variables by the researchers in order to establish a cause-and-effect relationship or to identify any potential relationship between different variables. Experiments involve deliberately manipulated scenarios where lurking variables are carefully controlled to facilitate drawing accurate and specific conclusions.

An experiment is considered **single-blind** when the participants are unaware of the treatment they are receiving. An experiment is termed **double-blind** if both the participants and the experimenters are unaware of which treatment is being given to each individual. This helps eliminate biases and prevents intentional or subconscious influence by the experimenters on the results.

**Statistical significance** does not refer to the importance or magnitude of a result, but rather to the probability that a result is due to chance. Determining whether this result is statistically significant or not depends on two factors â€” the probability of obtaining this result by chance and our personal inclination to believe that something unlikely has occurred.

_Experiments_ are generally considered more powerful than _observational studies_ as they offer greater control over the variables being examined. However, there are instances where controlling experimental units may be ethically or practically challenging, making observations the preferred approach. In such cases, we rely on collecting and analyzing observational data to gain insights and make informed conclusions.
