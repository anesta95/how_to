The **mean** of a set of numbers `x` is the sum of the numbers in the set divided by how many numbers are in the set: `sum(x) / length(x)`

The **median** of a set of numbers `x` is the value that splits the set in half when it is ordered from least to greatest, the middle number in a set of values.
In a set with an even number of values, the median is calculated by finding the mean of the _middle two_ values.

The mean and median are known as **measures of central tendency**. This is because they both show what the “center” of the distribution is, although they do it in slightly different ways.

The **mode** is the value in a data set that occurs most frequently. Note that the mode can be more than one value. Unlike median and mean, mode can be applied to data sets that contain non-numerical values. Anytime someone speaks of the "most popular" or "most common" item in a set, that person is likely referring to the mode of the set.

A distribution of data is considered _bimodal_ when it has two distinct peaks, even if the peaks do not have identical heights. It is often the case that when we find bi-modal distributions of data, there is some important factor in the data that we've ignored.

For "regular" or "normal" distributions, we would expect the median, mean, and mode to all be close to the same value.
