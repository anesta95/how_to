# [2.7 Exercises](https://walker-data.com/census-r/an-introduction-to-tidycensus.html#exercises)

1. Review the available geographies in tidycensus from the geography table in this chapter. Acquire data on median age (variable B01002_001) for a geography we have not yet used.

```{r}
csa_median_age <- get_acs(
  geography = "combined statistical area",
  variables = c(medage = "B01002_001"),
  year = 2022
)
```

2. Use the load_variables() function to find a variable that interests you that we havenâ€™t used yet. Use get_acs() to fetch data from the 2016-2020 ACS for counties in the state where you live, where you have visited, or where you would like to visit.

```{r}
ny_doctorate_counties <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  state = "NY",
  variables = c(num_doc = "B15003_025"),
  year = 2022
)
```
