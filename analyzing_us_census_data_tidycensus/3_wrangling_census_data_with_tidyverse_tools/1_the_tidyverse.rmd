# [3.1 The tidyverse](https://walker-data.com/census-r/wrangling-census-data-with-tidyverse-tools.html#the-tidyverse)

[The tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages that are designed to work together in common data wrangling, analysis, and visualization projects. Some of the key packages you'll use in the tidyverse include:

* __readr__, which contains tools for importing and exporting datasets.
* __dplyr__, a powerful framework for data wrangling tasks.
* __tidyr__, a package for reshaping data.
* __purrr__, a comprehensive framework for functional programming and iteration.
* __ggplot2__, a data visualization package based on the [Grammar of Graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf).

The core data structure used in the tidyverse is the tibble, which is an R data frame with some small enhancements to improve the user experience. __tidycensus__ returns tibbles by default.
