# Goal
The purpose of this first mini-project is to put your newly acquired `ggplot2` skills into practice and make sure you’ve absorbed the key concepts from the first module.

Your task: pick one of the datasets below, open R locally (or in a cloud setup), and create a few basic charts to visualize it. No need to get fancy yet — we’ll dive into customization in the upcoming modules.

# Datasets
Palmer Penguins: Easy
HYDE: Population & Land Use: Easy
The Simpsons episodes dataset: Medium

# Let's Go!
Try to create at least five charts using the provided datasets. Feel free to focus on one dataset or experiment with all of them — you’re the project lead and the data explorer here!

Open R in your favorite IDE, load one of the datasets, and start exploring and visualising the data. If you’re unsure how to set up your own project, check out the [bonus lesson](https://www.ggplot2-uncharted.com/bonus/own-r-project).

# Done With One Chart — or Even All Five?
