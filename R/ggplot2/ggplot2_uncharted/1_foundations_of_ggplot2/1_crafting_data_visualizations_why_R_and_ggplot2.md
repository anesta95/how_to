# A World of Visualization Tools
There are 5 main categories of visualization tools.

1. Graphic Design Tool: Vector-based tools for creating and refining graphics. Great for polished, presentation-ready visualizations but requires a lot of hands-on efforts. Examples: Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Figma, Canva
2. Spreadsheet Software: Simple and fast charting directly from tables. Useful for basic analysis but limited in style and flexibility. Examples: Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc
3. Business Intelligence (BI) Platforms: Drag-and-drop tools for building reports and dashboards. Ideal for monitoring KPIs but less customizable for storytelling. Examples: Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio
4. No-Code Chart Builders: Online tools for quick, publish-ready charts. Great for communication but often limited in fine-grained control. Examples: Datawrapper, RAWGraphs, Flourish
5. Programming Libraries for Visualization: Code-based tools for creating flexible, data-driven visualizations. Perfect for analysis and automation but requires programming skills. Examples: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, d3.js

# Why Coding?

1. Reproducibility: Unlike point-and-click tools, a code-first approach offers unparalleled transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency.
2. Customization: Coding also opens the door to full customization— fine-tune the layout, modify colors and shapes, add dynamic labeling logic, or craft uncommon charts.
3. Automatization: automate the process of creating plots for a range of subsets, variable combinations, or even data sets; apply your personal theme or corporate style guide to ensure consistent and efficient styling (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.) across all your plot.

# Why ggplot2?
ggplot2 adheres to the [Grammar of Graphics](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Grammar_of_Graphics.html?id=_kRX4LoFfGQC) which allows you to combine different components to create everything — from simple bar charts to complex, multi-faceted plots with just a few lines of code by treating charts as layered, structured expressions of data. ggplot2 has inspired tools like Vega, Altair, Plotnine, and even Power BI. Many modern JavaScript libraries like D3.js and Observable Plot also embrace the same philosophy, letting users declaratively compose charts using shared principles.
