# gray Gotcha again!

We're trying to create a histogram comparing two distributions, but something's not working as expected. The **areas should be filled with different colors** to distinguish easily between the two variables.

Please fix the code to make sure the bars are filled properly!

Bonus Task: Add a black outline to the bars.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Build dataset with 2 distributions
set.seed(123) # to always return the same random numbers
data <- data.frame(
  type = c(rep("A", 1000), rep("B", 1000)),
  value = c(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000, mean = 4))
)

# Histogram (2 groups)
ggplot(data) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(x = value, fill = type), color = "black" # Here `fill` controls the color inside the bars and `color` controls the outline for geom_histogram(), geom_bar()/geom_col()
  )
```

Understanding the difference between **color** and **fill** is crucial when working with different types of geoms in `ggplot2`. This is a common source of confusion!

# Line Meltdown

The new analyst of "Ben & Queries" visualized the yearly ratings of two ice cream flavors 🍦

But their plot looks... odd. The line jumps back and forth across years, instead of showing two clear trends. 😕

Can you spot what went wrong in the code?

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  year = rep(2016:2024, times = 2),
  rating = c(8.2, 8.5, 7.9, 8.1, 8, 8.4, 8.2, 8.1, 8.5, 
             7.1, 6.4, 9.8, 4.3, 7.3, 5.9, 7.1, 8.7, 9.3),
  flavor_type = rep(c("Classic Vanilla", "Special Flavor of the Year"), each = 9)
)

# Wrong chart, connects all the points into a single line
ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = rating)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = "flavor_type")) +
  labs(title = "Ben & Queries Flavor Trends: Calm Vanilla, Wild Specials")

# Correct chart, one line per category
ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = rating)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = flavor_type)) +
  labs(title = "Ben & Queries Flavor Trends: Calm Vanilla, Wild Specials")
```

Aesthetics **map visual properties to variables** — so if you wrap a column name in quotes, `ggplot2` treats it as a fixed label, not a reference to your data.

That means your plot won’t behave as expected: instead of drawing one line per category, `ggplot2` tries to connect all the points into a single line — resulting in a wonky zig-zag.

# Mayday, We Have a Problem!

Someone tried to create a scatterplot showing the relationship between temperature and ozone concentration in the `airquality` dataset.

They also wanted to explore how wind might affect these variables. But their code has a fundamental issue.

-   Can you figure out **why the code doesn't make sense?**
-   How could you **represent wind as a third dimension instead?**

```{r}
# This won't work because Wind is a numeric variable and the shape aesthetic requires categories
# ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) + geom_point(aes(shape = Wind))

# Mapping wind to color and shape will work for numeric aesthetic
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) + geom_point(aes(color = Wind, size = Wind))
```

`ggplot2` lets you **map variables to visual properties** rather than choosing a fixed chart type.

That’s powerful — but it means you need to **be mindful of the data type each aesthetic expects**. Mapping a numeric variable to an aesthetic that requires categories (like `shape`) doesn’t make sense!

# Category Confusion

This code just works fine, the resulting scatterplot encodes different vehicle classes. But wait... Something is missing!

**Take a moment to think about what is the issue and why it happens. How could you fix it?**

Hint: You may want to use a different encoding to avoid some data to disappear from your plot...

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = class))

# Using color instead of shape to encode `class` variable since there are 7 discrete categories
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))

```

It is important to carefully inspect your visualization to ensure the data is accurately represented and matches your expectations.

There is only a limited number of default shapes that `ggplot2` uses — thus, there is a risk that some categories are encoded with no shapes at all!

And a more general note on encoding categories: Colors are easier to distinguish than shapes. Nevertheless, many experts suggest to **limit the number of categories** to 3, 5, 6, or 8 (depending on whom you ask).

# Lost for Words

We're trying to create a scatterplot of engine size vs. fuel economy using the `mpg` dataset, with text labels showing the car manufacturer.

We can **use geom_text() to add *labels*** — but something’s not working. Can you figure out what’s missing?

Tip: Use our **Aesthetics Explorer** in the fundamental lesson on aesthetics if you need help.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  # add the mandatory label mapping
  geom_text(aes(label = manufacturer))
```

Some geometries **require specific aesthetics to work correctly**. If you try to use them without those required aesthetics, you'll run into errors or unexpected behavior.

It makes sense — how can you draw some text if you don’t specify *what* the text should be? 🤦‍♂️

In the next lesson, we’ll give you a full list of geometric layers along with their required aesthetics!
