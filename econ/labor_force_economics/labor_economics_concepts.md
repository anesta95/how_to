The US labor market can be broadly characterized by the matchup of supply and demand. One measure for the supply is the total size of the [civilian labor force](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLF16OV)
which is estimated by the household BLS/Census Current Population Survey (CPS).

One way to judge job growth is the _breakeven rate_. This is the number of jobs needed to be added every month to keep the labor market steady. Another way to say this is what is the
amount of job growth that needs to occur to keep the unemployment rate (i.e. the number of people in the labor force looking for work but unable to find work as a proportion of the 
total labor force) from rising.

Another key metric is the _job finding rate_. This can be calculated as the percent of workers who are unemployed that move from unemployed to employed in a given time period. 
This can be calculated from the CPS as well.

To look at _immigration_ one metric is the percentage of the civilian labor force  who are foreign born (not a one-to-one of course). This can also be calculated from the CPS. 
Other metrics include border crossings and immigrant visas issued.
