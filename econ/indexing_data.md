# [Indexing data to a common starting point](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/indexing)

## The economic problem
### Start data at the same point

A relatively simple way to make such comparisons is by indexing data to a common starting point. In effect, the variables in question must be set equal to each other and then examined over time for differences.

### Indexing enables comparison of data of any magnitude

Economists index data to prominent events—say economic peaks (or troughs)—to see how the data decline (or rise) relative to each other. In all cases, it allows for quick comparison and ranking.

## The technical solution

To index numerical data, values must be adjusted so they are equal to each other in a given starting time period. By convention, this value is usually 100. From there on, every value is normalized to the start value, maintaining the same percentage changes as in the nonindexed series. Subsequent values are calculated so that percent changes in the indexed series are the same as in the nonindexed.

To index two series of data, apply the following equation to the raw data:


$\hat{X}_t = \left(\frac{X_t}{X_0} \right)\cdot 100$


Where $X_t$ is the raw data in a give time period, $X_0$ is the data value in the **initial** time period and $\hat{X}_t$ is the new indexed value of the variable.

### Summary

The indexing methodology can be used with various types of economic data. It can be an effective means of normalizing data to a common starting point and observing how variables change over time relative to each other. It is a common method used by economists and business people to enhance perspective and understanding of economic trends.
