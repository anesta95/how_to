# The Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It performs five general
functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and, more generally, the public
interest.

The Federal Reserve:

1. conducts the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices in
the U.S. economy
2. promotes the stability of the financial system and seeks to minimize and contain systemic
risks through active monitoring and engagement in the U.S. and abroad
3. promotes the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and monitors their
impact on the financial system as a whole through supervision and regulation
4. fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency through services to the banking
industry and the U.S. government that facilitate U.S.-dollar transactions and payments
5. promotes consumer protection and community development through consumer-focused
supervision and examination, research and analysis of emerging consumer issues and trends,
community economic development activities, and the administration of consumer laws and
regulations.

The Federal Reserve System has 1 U.S. central bank, 3 key entities (Federal Reserve board of governors, 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee a.k.a FOMC), and 5 key functions: Conducting the nation's monetary policy; helping maintain the stability of the financial system; supervising and regulating financial institutions; fostering payment and settlement system safety and efficiency; and promoting consumer protection and community development. 

## The Fed and the Dual Mandate

Congress has given the Federal Reserve two main goals, often referred to as a "dual mandate": Maximum employment and price stability. Price stability here means that the __inflation rate__ remains low and stable *over the long run*. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — the Fed's monetary policy making group — has stated it would like inflation to average 2% over time. Maximum employment is the highest level of employment that the economy can sustain over time. The FOMC determines how the labor market _is_ doing compared to how it _potentially_ could be doing if it were at maximum employment. To do this, it looks at a wide range of economic indicators, including job vacancies, hiring plans, quits rate, average earnings, and the unemployment rate. 

## How Does the Fed Achieve its Dual Mandate
The FOMC meets to decide what the appropriate target range for the Federal Funds Rate should be. The Federal Funds Rate is a short term interest rate. The Fed then uses its policy tools to steer the federal funds rate into this target range. When the federal funds rate moves it affects other interest rates, which then have broader impacts throughout the economy by influencing financial conditions that temper how households and businesses spend and invest. Those choices in turn affect employment and prices.

# Inflation Expectations, the Phillips Curve, and the Fed's Dual Mandate
## Price Stability: One Side of the Dual Mandate
Price stability does not mean that the optimal rate of inflation is zero. The Fed, for example, judges that a moderate, stable, and positive rate of inflation is most consistent with its price stability mandate.

Why do central banks target positive rates of inflation? First, they want to avoid **deflation**, a general and persistent decline in the level of prices. Aiming for a moderate positive rate of price increases helps protect the economy from periods of deflation. Deflation is a phenomenon Americans last experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s. At that time, deflation led households to delay making purchases in anticipation of lower prices in the future, and this action put pressure on producers to cut wages or jobs or both. These deflationary factors put severe strains on the economy.

When inflation is very low, interest rates also tend to be very low, even in good times. When an economy weakens, perhaps goes into a recession, a central bank will normally reduce interest rates to encourage spending and investment by households and businesses. But if interest rates are already very low going into the recession, the central bank does not have much room to reduce interest rates to help stimulate the economy.

Price stability does not mean any positive rate of inflation. As we just noted, inflation that is too low is close to deflation and may not allow a central bank to support a weakening economy. Conversely, inflation that is too high means that the purchasing power of the dollar erodes very quickly, which disproportionately affects lower-income families and older citizens on fixed incomes.

In the United States, the FOMC aims for 2 percent inflation over time. In the FOMC’s judgment, 2 percent provides a healthy compromise—high enough to provide a meaningful buffer from deflation while minimizing the distortions that arise from high inflation.

## Inflation Data
The overall inflation rate is measured as the rate of increase in the average price level of a broad group of goods and services — called a “[market basket](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2015/10/01/whats-in-your-market-basket-why-your-inflation-rate-might-differ-from-the-average”). As such, the reported inflation rate will be a function of the specific goods and services that are included in the market basket. So it follows that including a different set of goods and services in the market basket will result in a different overall inflation rate.

Probably the most often-discussed inflation measure in the United States is one based on the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is widely used as a cost-of-living index to adjust Social Security and other payments. A second measure that is frequently watched is the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCEPI). In January 2012, when the FOMC announced for the first time a numeric inflation objective, it specified a 2 percent inflation target for the PCEPI as the inflation rate most consistent with its Congressional mandate of price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC chose the PCEPI over the CPI, in part, because it includes a broader set of goods and services in its market basket and is believed to better capture changes in consumer behavior.

## The Phillips Curve: The Changing Relationship Between Inflation and Employment 

A key to understanding the Fed’s dual mandate is considering how inflation relates to economic activity. In the late 1950s, William Phillips documented a *negative relationship* between **wage inflation** and **unemployment** in the United Kingdom.

The bottom right of the curve captures data from a weak economy—when unemployment is high and wage inflation is low. This is most likely to occur during a recession. Here, resources such as labor are underutilized; you might say there is “slack” in the economy. In this situation, many workers are looking for jobs, and companies do not have incentives to raise wages much (if at all) to attract or keep workers.

Conversely, the top left of the curve—where wage inflation is high and unemployment is low—reflects an economy that is running hot, perhaps having been expanding for a number of years. Here the labor market may be considered tight, with most people having jobs. In such an economy, firms looking for more workers must compete with each other by significantly boosting wages or offering better benefits to lure them from other opportunities. This is a situation where unemployment is low and wage inflation is high.

Since labor costs represent about two-thirds of firms’ total cost of production, they are very important for firms’ pricing decisions. By the mid-1960s, economists Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow had noted a similar relationship in the United States between price inflation and unemployment that we now typically refer to as the traditional “price Phillips curve” or simply the “Phillips curve.”

U.S. data from the 1960s illustrate the standard price inflation-unemployment curve well. Thus, the Phillips curve captured a tradeoff that policymakers considered when setting monetary policy: They could pursue an economy with lower unemployment if they were willing to accept higher inflation. Conversely, if policymakers wanted to pursue lower inflation, they would have to accept higher unemployment and lower economic activity.

This inverse relationship Phillips described has "flattened" in recent years, prompting debate among economists and policymakers. As recently noted by Fed Chair Powell, “Inflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times.” This fact has occurred despite big fluctuations in unemployment. Over the past 20 years, there has not been a strong relationship between inflation and unemployment. This evidence has led economists to say that the Phillips curve has flattened.

Policymakers recognize this flat Phillips curve, which allows them to pursue lower unemployment without having to accept higher inflation. That is, the long-standing presumption that monetary policy should be tightened as unemployment falls to low levels to head off high inflation is no longer how policymakers necessarily think and act. Today, policymakers are willing to allow employment to expand as long as inflation expectations are anchored around the FOMC’s 2 percent target. In light of these issues, in 2020 the Fed adjusted its strategy for achieving price stability.

## Inflation Expectations
Inflation expectations are just what they sound like—expectations that households and businesses have about future inflation. Inflation expectations are important because they influence peoples’ decisionmaking today, which then impacts future inflation.

Recently, economists at the Fed constructed an index of common inflation expectations using 21 of these measures. The index captures the general trajectory of many of the long-horizon inflation expectation indicators. A summary of the index of common inflation expectations is found [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/index-of-common-inflation-expectations-20200902.html).

## Fed's Actions to Achieve Stable Prices

Three important points regarding price stability in the statement include the following:

* The Committee’s longer-run goal for inflation, as measured by the annual change in the PCEPI, is 2 percent.
* Longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent are desired to achieve the Committee's Congressional mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
* To anchor longer-term inflation expectations at 2 percent, the FOMC will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.

In 2020 the FOMC adjusted its statement on longer-run goals to emphasize that it’s looking for inflation that averages 2 percent over time. The Committee believes that “by seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time this will help ensure longer-run inflation expectations do not drift down and remain well anchored at 2 percent.”

This approach has been referred to as a flexible average inflation target (FAIT) policy. FAIT means the inflation goal is symmetric around 2 percent, which means that sometimes inflation may be a bit above 2 percent and at other times may be a bit below 2 percent. But, on average, it should be 2 percent.

## Going Forward from 2020
After running persistently below 2 percent for nearly a decade, inflation moved up above 2 percent in the first half of 2021. In response, the FOMC stated that it believed these price increases were reflecting transitory factors (see below). The FOMC also indicated that it is aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a bit of time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time, consistent with its FAIT policy. In addition, given that the Phillips curve is quite flat, there does not seem to be a strong “tradeoff” between raising inflation and overheating the labor market. This means that policymakers can aim for both further improvements in the labor market and moving inflation above 2 percent, so long as inflation expectations are consistent with the long-run 2 percent objective.

## What is "Transitory" Inflation?
The "over time" part of the definition of the Fed's mandate to promote price stability means the Fed won’t react to every bump or dip in inflation. Rather, the Fed wants to see if a given change in the price level signals transitory or persistently higher or lower future inflation.

Transitory inflation is a short-lived, or temporary, increase in inflation with the expectation that inflation will return to a lower level not too far in the future. This might occur for a couple of reasons.

First, inflation is often measured as a 12-month change, so it’s calculated as a percent change between two index number that are 12 months apart. If the price index fell 12 months ago, as it did in Spring 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak halted many activities, the calculations a year later would show extra inflation because the level a year ago was temporarily low. This is what’s often called base effects. Of course, that low level will “fall out” of the calculation window as time moves on. Hence, the higher inflation readings will be (all else equal) short-lived, not a sign of persistently high inflation.

Another example is a bottleneck, which is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain. Think of the supply chain disruptions that can result from an event like a storm or pandemic. These events might cause an increase in the prices of key goods and services that show up in the inflation numbers, but it will likely be short lived as workers and businesses recover and adapt. The important point to remember is that the Fed intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to persistently high or low inflation, especially inflation that moves inflation expectations away from 2 percent.
