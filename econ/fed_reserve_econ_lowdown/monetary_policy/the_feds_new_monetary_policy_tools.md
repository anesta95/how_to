## The Tools

### The Supplementary Tool: Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility
Not every financial institution can open a reserve balance account at the Fed and earn interest on these reserves. So, it’s possible that the federal funds rate could fall below the interest on reserve balances rate. To supplement interest on reserve balances’ influence on the federal funds rate, the Fed offers the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility to a broad set of large financial institutions, which includes money market mutual funds. When an institution uses the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, it deposits funds at the Fed overnight, receiving a **government security** as collateral. The next day the transaction is “unwound”—the Fed buys back the security. The Fed offers these institutions the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offering rate (referred to as the “ON RRP offering rate” from this point forward, and labeled “ON RRP rate” on the graphs used in this module) on the funds deposited at the Fed.

For these institutions, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility provides an opportunity to deposit funds at the Fed to earn a risk-free return—similar to the opportunity offered to banks that deposit funds at the Fed to earn interest on their reserve balances. Like the interest on reserve balances rate, the ON RRP offering rate is an administered rate; that is, a rate the Fed sets. And, like the interest on reserve balances rate, the ON RRP offering rate serves as a reservation rate for these institutions. Because this is a risk-free investment option, the institutions will likely never be willing to lend funds in any market for lower than the ON RRP offering rate. And these institutions can arbitrage as well: If similar short-term rates fell too far below the ON RRP offering rate, institutions would arbitrage—they would borrow at those lower rates and deposit the funds at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility to earn a profit.

A **government security** is a bonds, notes, and other debt instruments sold by a government to finance its expenditures.

The ON RRP offering rate is set below the interest on reserve balances rate, so the ON RRP offering rate helps set a floor for the federal funds rate.

### Discount Rate: Setting a Ceiling for the Federal Funds Rate
The discount rate is the rate charged by the Fed for loans obtained through the Fed’s discount window. Notice that the interest on reserve balances and the ON RRP offering rates both involve depositing funds at the Fed, but *the discount window is where banks borrow from the Fed*.

Because banks will not likely borrow at a higher rate than they can borrow from the Fed, the discount rate acts as a ceiling for the federal funds rate: it is set higher than the interest on reserve balances rate and the ON RRP offering rate. The Fed usually adjusts the discount rate and other administered rates (interest on reserve balances rate and ON RRP offering rate) by the same amount and at the same time so that they move up and down together.

Because banks historically used the discount window for borrowing in times of trouble, there has been a “stigma” associated with borrowing from the discount window. Banks feared the perception that taking a loan from the Fed might indicate a problem. This effect likely makes the discount window a less effective ceiling, but it serves as a backstop, nonetheless.

# The Final Tool: Open Market Operations
The Fed’s current method for implementing monetary policy relies on banks’ reserves remaining “ample.” Graphically, this means that the supply curve remains far enough to the right that it doesn’t intersect the demand curve in the downward sloping portion: This horizontal portion of the demand curve is where reserves are ample. So, if the Fed needs to add reserves (shifting the supply curve to the right), it does so by buying U.S. government securities on the open market. This action is known as open market operations. When the Fed buys securities, it pays for them by depositing funds into the appropriate banks’ reserve balance accounts, adding to the overall level of reserves in the banking system.

Open market operations are an important tool for ensuring that reserves remain ample. 

## Putting the Tools into Practice
### Expansionary Monetary Policy Using the Fed's Tools
Suppose the economy weakens and employment falls short of maximum employment. Meanwhile, the inflation rate has been steady around 2 percent but is now showing signs of decreasing. The FOMC might decide to use **expansionary** monetary policy to provide stimulus for the economy. That is, the FOMC could lower its target range for the federal funds rate. When doing so, the Fed would decrease the administered rates—interest on reserve balances rate, ON RRP offering rate, and discount rate—accordingly. See the animation below.

These actions would transmit to other interest rates and broader financial conditions.

* Lower interest rates decrease the cost of borrowing money, which encourages consumers to increase spending on goods and services and encourages businesses to invest in new equipment.
* The increase in consumption spending by consumers and investment spending by businesses increases the overall demand for goods and services in the economy.
* With increased production, businesses are likely to hire additional employees and spend more on other resources.
* As these increases in spending ripple through the economy, unemployment decreases, moving the unemployment rate down toward its full employment level, and inflation possibly could move up.

So, the Fed’s monetary policy implementation tools can be effective for moving the economy back toward the maximum employment and price stability objectives when the economy is stalling.
### Contractionary Monetary Policy Using the Fed's Tools
Suppose the economy is showing signs of overheating, with the unemployment rate very low and businesses finding it hard to fill jobs. The inflation rate has been above the Fed’s 2 percent target for quite some time and is rising. In this case, the FOMC might decide to use **contractionary** monetary policy to bring inflation back to the Fed’s goal of averaging 2 percent over time. To do so, the FOMC could raise its target range for the federal funds rate. When doing so, the Fed would increase the administered rates—interest on reserve balances rate, ON RRP offering rate, and discount rate—accordingly. See the animation below. 

These actions would transmit to other interest rates and broader financial conditions. 

* Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing money, which discourages consumers from spending on some goods and services and reduces businesses' investment in new equipment.
* The decrease in consumption spending by consumers and investment spending by businesses decreases the overall demand for goods and services in the economy.
* Note that the goal of contractionary monetary policy is to dampen the demand for goods and services, not to stop it.
* With decreased production, businesses are less likely to hire additional employees or spend more on other resources.
* As these decreases in spending ripple through the economy, demand for workers could lessen, inflationary pressures would diminish, and the inflation rate would fall back toward 2 percent.

So, higher interest rates can be used to move the economy back to the maximum employment and price stability objectives when the economy is overheating.
