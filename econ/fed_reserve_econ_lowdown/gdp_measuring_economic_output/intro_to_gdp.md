# Introduction
Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year. GDP is calculated as total spending on personal consumption, gross private investment, government purchases, and net exports.

# Definition of GDP
* __Market value__: The price at which a good or service sells in the marketplace.
* __Final goods and services__: Goods and services sold to end users and have been purchased for final use and not for resale or further processing.
* __Intermediate goods__: A man-made good that is used to produce another good or service, becoming part of that good or service. They are not counted separately in GDP to avoid double-counting.

For example, flour is an intermediate good in the production of a bakery cake. Only the cake is counted in GDP, and the market value of the cake includes the value of the flour and other ingredients.

GDP includes goods and services produced in the United States, _including those that are exported_. This also includes goods and services produced by foreign-owned companies operating in the United States. GDP _does not_ include goods and services produced in other countries even if the goods were produced by a U.S. company in another country. 

# Components of GDP
Assume that everything produced during one year is also bought during that year. Then, by adding up all purchases of final goods and services during the year, we could measure GDP. Essentially — with a few adjustments — this is the way economists measure GDP.

The method of measuring GDP involves adding **consumption expenditures** by households ($C$), **investment expenditures** by businesses ($I$), **government expenditures** on goods and services ($G$), and net exports, which refers to **exports** minus **imports** ($X - M$).

$GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)$

## Consumption expenditures
A measurement of goods and services purchased by U.S. residents. Includes household purchases of durable consumer goods, such as cars, televisions, refrigerators and computers; household purchases of nondurable consumer goods, such as food and clothing; and household purchases of services, such as car repair, haircuts and doctors visits.

Consumption expenditures can also be referred to as "personal consumption expenditures".

## Investment expenditures
Gross private investment, or simply business investment, is spending by businesses on machinery, factories, equipment, tools, and construction of new buildings. In this case, investment _does not_ refer to buying financial investments, such as stocks and bonds. 

## Government expenditures
All federal, state and local government spending on final goods and services. These include finished products such as desks, computers, military tanks and so on. It also includes all purchases of services by government, such as payment for the work of social workers, Veterans' Administration doctors and nurses, and U.S. Senators and Representatives. 

It *does not* include government transfer payments, such as Social Security, farm subsidies, or welfare payments, because these expenditures do not reflect production of goods and services. These are, instead, transfer payments that redistribute income the government receives from tax revenues to certain groups or individuals. 

## Net exports
Net exports refers to the value of goods and services exported to other countries minus the value of goods and services that foreigners provide us (imports). If the United States imports more goods and services than it exports in a given year, then the $(X - M)$ number would be negative.

**Exports**: Resources, goods, and services that are produced domestically but sold abroad. Exports are sent into a region from outside that region.
**Imports**: Resources, goods, and services that are produced abroad but sold domestically. Imports are brought into a region from outside a region.

# Per Capita GDP
Per capita GDP is a country's Gross Domestic Product divided by its population. It is a measure of the amount of goods and services available to each person in a country, on average. Per capita GDP, then, is a measure of standard of living — how many goods and services are available per person in a country.
