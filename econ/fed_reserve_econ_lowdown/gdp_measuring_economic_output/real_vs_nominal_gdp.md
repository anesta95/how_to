# Let's Get Real
Even though GDP is a valuable measurement tool, prices are used in calculating the value of output. This causes difficulty with calculating changes in GDP over time because an increase in GDP could mean any of the following:
1. The country has produced more goods and services.
2. The country has produced the same amount of goods and services, but the prices of those goods and services are higher.
3. Some combination of higher production levels and higher prices has caused GDP to increase.

Often the increase in _income_ is a _combination_ of both the increase in the _price_ of goods and services as well as the increase in _output_ of those same goods and services.

If we want to use GDP to measure the "real" increase or decrease over time in the level of final goods and services produced, we must remove the effect of price changes from the data. Therefore, **real GDP** controls for inflation and more accurately reflects actual economic growth. When economists discuss GDP, they are usually referring to real GDP. When GDP is presented in its unadjusted form, it is often labeled **nominal GDP**. In economics, the word "real" means that a measure adjusted for inflation and is measured in constant prices, that is, in prices of a given or base period. When examining GDP over time, it's important to use ***real GDP**.
