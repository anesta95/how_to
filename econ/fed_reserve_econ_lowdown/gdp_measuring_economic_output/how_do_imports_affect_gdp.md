# Measuring GDP

GDP can be measured equally well by counting either total expenditures or total income. Because any spending is someone’s income and vice versa, using either measurement approach results in the same answer. Of course, tracking an actual economy is a bit more complicated.

# Domestic Expenditures
The typical textbook treatment of GDP is the expenditure approach, where spending is categorized into the following buckets: personal consumption expenditures (C); gross private investment (I); government purchases (G); and net exports (X – M), composed of **exports** (X) and **imports** (M). Textbooks often capture this in one relatively simple equation:

```math
\text{GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)}
```

Components of GDP
* Personal consumption expenditures (C): Household expenditures for durable and nondurable consumer goods and services.
* Gross private investment (I): Business expenditures for newly produced capital goods (machinery, equipment, tools, and buildings), household purchases of homes, and additions to inventories.
* Government purchases (G): Government expenditures for goods and services that the government consumes in providing public goods and for public capital that has a long lifetime.
* Exports (X): Goods or services that are produced domestically but sold abroad.
* Imports (M): Goods or services that are produced abroad but sold domestically.

The equation is an identity—an equation that is true for all values of the variables because of the way the variables are defined. So an extra dollar of spending on C, I, G, or X will also increase GDP by one dollar.

# The Misleading Aspects of Net Exports
International trade is captured in the net exports portion of the expenditures equation ((X − M)). In this approach, exports (X) are added in the same way as the other variables (C, I, and G) and contribute to GDP—an extra dollar of spending increases GDP by one dollar. However, in the expenditures equation, imports (M) are subtracted. On the surface, this implies that an extra dollar of spending on imports (M) would decrease GDP by one dollar. For example, let’s assume you spend $30,000 on an imported car; because imports are subtracted (i.e., “−M”), the equation seems to imply that $30,000 should be subtracted from GDP. However, this cannot be correct because GDP measures *domestic* production, so imports (foreign production) should have no impact on GDP.

# Correcting Misconceptions
When the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) measures economic output, it categorizes spending with the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Some of this spending, which is counted as C, I, and G, is spent on imported goods.1 As such, the value of imports must be subtracted to ensure that only spending on domestic goods is measured in GDP. For example, $30,000 spent on an imported car is counted as a personal consumption expenditure (C), but then the $30,000 is subtracted as an import (M) to ensure that only the value of domestic production is counted. As such, the imports variable (M) functions as an accounting variable rather than an expenditure variable. ***To be clear, the purchase of domestic goods and services increases GDP because it increases domestic production, but the purchase of imported goods and services has no direct impact on GDP.***

This approach to GDP allows for correct accounting of **intermediate goods** in a global economy where few goods fall cleanly into the two buckets of being produced either domestically or abroad. In fact, most “domestically produced” goods include some foreign parts or components. It is also important to notice that while C, I, and G measure spending on only final goods and services, exports (X) and imports (M) also include intermediate goods.

For example, if $10,000 in imported parts are used in the production of a car in a U.S. factory (an “American” car) and the car is sold in the United States for $30,000, then the $30,000 counts as personal consumption expenditures (C); but $10,000 is subtracted to account for the value of the imported (M) parts, so the effect on U.S. GDP is $20,000.

Exports of intermediate goods also count. For example, assume an American business produces and sells $30,000 in parts to a foreign business that uses them to assemble a product in its country. While much of the focus in counting GDP is on final goods and services, exports of intermediate goods contribute to GDP. In this case, exporting $30,000 in parts will increase U.S. GDP by $30,000. This accounting helps capture the truly global nature of many products.

# Conclusion
GDP measures domestic production of final goods and services. The expenditure approach calculates GDP using total spending on domestic goods; but the equation, as stated, can lead to a misunderstanding of how imports affect GDP. More specifically, the expenditure equation seems to imply that imports reduce economic output. For example, in nearly every quarter since 1976, net exports (X − M) have been negative, which seems to imply that trade reduces domestic output and growth.

This can influence people’s perspective on trade. This essay explains that the imports variable (M) corrects for the value of imports that have already been counted as personal consumption (C), gross private investment (I), or government purchases (G). And remember, the purchase of domestic goods and services should increase GDP, but the purchase of imported goods and services should have *no direct impact* on GDP.
