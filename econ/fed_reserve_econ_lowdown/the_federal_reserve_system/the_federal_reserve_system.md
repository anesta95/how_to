# The Five General Functions of the Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. In order to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and, more generally, the public
interest the Federal Reserve:

* conducts the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices in
the U.S. economy;
* promotes the stability of the financial system and seeks to minimize and contain systemic
risks through active monitoring and engagement in the U.S. and abroad;
* promotes the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and monitors their
impact on the financial system as a whole;
* fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency through services to the banking
industry and the U.S. government that facilitate U.S.-dollar transactions and payments; and
* promotes consumer protection and community development through consumer-focused
supervision and examination, research and analysis of emerging consumer issues and trends,
community economic development activities, and the administration of consumer laws and
regulations.

The Federal Reserve has a unique structure with the Board of Governors overseeing the system, and 12 Reserve Banks that serve regional needs. 

# Making Sense of the Federal Reserve

### History and Purpose of the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve was created by an act of Congress in 1913. A severe financial panic in 1907 crippled the banking system and prompted Congress to set up a central bank.

The "central bank" is the generic name given to a country's primary monetary authority. A nation's central bank is usually given a mix of responsibilities including determining the money supply, supervising banks, providing banking services for the government, lending to banks during crises, and promoting consumer protection and community development.

Nationally, the central bank had to make it easier to conduct financial transactions between businesses and individuals across regions of the country. Regionally, the central bank would have to respond to the local needs for currency, which could vary across regions. A lack of available currency had caused the earlier banking panics.

The emerging Federal Reserve system was a _central bank_ under _public control_, with many checks and balances.

Congress oversees the entire Federal Reserve System. And the Fed must work within the objectives established by Congress. Yet Congress gave the Federal Reserve the autonomy to carry out its responsibilities without political pressure. Each of the Fed's three parts—the Board of Governors, the regional Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)—operates independently of the federal government to carry out the Fed's core responsibilities.

### The Fed Board of Governors
The Board consists of seven members who are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. These governors guide the Federal Reserve's policy actions.

A Federal Reserve governor's term length is 14 years. Appointments to the Board of Governors are staggered—one governor's term expires every two years. Terms are staggered to provide the Fed political independence as a central bank, ensuring that one president cannot take advantage of his power to appoint governors by "stacking the deck" with those who favor his policies. While the chair of the Federal Reserve Board must be elected to a fourteen-year term to be a governor, he or she must be reappointed every four years to the position of chair.

The seven governors, according to the original Federal Reserve Act, should represent the nation’s financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests. Geography is a factor, too, as every governor must be selected from a different Federal Reserve District. Recently Congress directed that at least one of the governors have experience in community banking. (In general, community banks can be defined as those owned by organizations with less than $10 billion in assets.) The seven governors, along with a host of economists and support staff, write the policies that ensure financially sound banks and a stable and strong national economy.

### Chair of the Federal Reserve Board
The Fed Chair and Vice Chairs are governors of the Federal Reserve Board whom the president of the United States appoints, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve four-year terms.

### Federal Reserve Banks
Reserve Banks operate somewhat independently but under the general oversight of the Board of Governors. These Reserve Banks, and their branches, are strategically located in large cities across the country. The economists and other employees in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts work together to provide a regional perspective and expert knowledge about their local economies.

Reserve Bank activities serve primarily three audiences—bankers, the U.S. Treasury, and the public.

Federal Reserve Banks are often called the "bankers' banks" because they provide services to commercial banks similar to the services that commercial banks provide for their customers. Federal Reserve Banks distribute currency and coin to banks, lend money to banks, and process electronic payments.

Reserve Banks also serve as fiscal agents for the U.S. government. They maintain accounts for the U.S. Treasury, process government checks, and conduct government securities auctions.

Reserve Banks conduct research on the regional, national, and international economies; prepare Reserve Bank presidents for their participation on the FOMC; and distribute information about the economy through publications, speeches, educational workshops, and websites. This helps the public and policy makers stay informed on economic conditions. 

### The Federal Reserve Banks and Currency
Reserve Banks serve as a bank for banks, offering a variety of financial services. They distribute currency and coin, processes checks, and offer electronic forms of payment.

In addition to serving as the bank for banks, the Federal Reserve System acts as the bank for the U.S. government. Federal Reserve Banks maintain accounts for the U.S. Treasury; process government checks, postal money orders, and U.S. savings bonds; and collect federal tax deposits. When the Treasury offers new issues of marketable securities to the public, certain Reserve Banks provide information about the issues, process orders from customers, collect payments, and credit the Treasury's account for the proceeds. The Fed and the U.S. Treasury process and deliver these services electronically.


### Who Owns the Federal Reserve Banks?
The Federal Reserve Banks are not a part of the federal government, but they exist because of an act of Congress. Their purpose is to serve the public. So is the Fed private or public?

The answer is both. While the Board of Governors is an independent government agency, the Federal Reserve Banks are set up like private corporations. Member banks hold stock in the Federal Reserve Banks and earn dividends. Holding this stock does not carry with it the control and financial interest given to holders of common stock in for-profit organizations. The stock may not be sold or pledged as collateral for loans. Member banks also elect six of the nine members of each Bank's board of directors.

Each Federal Reserve Bank has its own board of directors that oversees the Bank's activities. These directors contribute local business experience, community involvement, and leadership and reflect the diverse interests of each District. Each board has nine members. Six of the directors are elected by member commercial banks. Three of the directors are appointed by the Board of Governors. From among these three, the Board of Governors selects a chair and a deputy chair of the given Bank’s board.

### Federal Reserve Banks and Policy
Federal Reserve Banks carry out the Fed's policies at a regional level. Day to day, the banks execute the banking and consumer protection laws enacted by Congress and the regulatory policies adopted by the Board of Governors. The Reserve Banks also play a critical role in bringing local economic perspectives to the national arena.

Reserve Banks publish research, articles, and economic forecasts that people who live in their District might find useful. Also, because Reserve Bank staff members interact directly with local bankers—examining their books and offering financial services—they are knowledgeable about the effects of national policies on local banks and can funnel that information to the Board of Governors.

When Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913, it established 12 Federal Reserve Districts so that every part of the country would be represented in the System. Each District has a Federal Reserve Bank that serves and supervises member banks in that particular District. One of the most important venues where the Reserve Banks represent their Districts is at the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

### The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the Fed's chief body for monetary policy. Its voting membership combines the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other Reserve Bank presidents who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis with the other Reserve Bank presidents.

All Reserve Bank presidents attend FOMC meetings, however, even when they are not designated voting members. By tradition, the chair of the FOMC is also the chair of the Board of Governors.

The FOMC typically meets eight times a year in the Board Room at the Eccles Building in Washington, D.C.; but, when necessary, members will meet virtually. If economic conditions require additional meetings, the FOMC can and does meet more often.

At each regularly scheduled two-day FOMC meeting

* A senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York discusses developments in the financial and foreign exchange markets as well as activities of the New York Fed's Trading Desk where U.S. government securities are bought and sold.
* Staff from the Board of Governors then present their economic and financial forecasts.
* The Board's governors and all 12 Reserve Bank presidents--whether they are voting members that year or not--offer their assessments of recent developments and views on the economic outlook.

### The Fed and the Dual Mandate
The Federal Reserve System has been given a **dual mandate** — pursuing the economic goals of _maximum employment_ and _price stability_. It does this by using a variety of policy tools to manage financial conditions that encourage progress toward its dual mandate objectives—in other words, conducting monetary policy.

### The FOMC Conducts Monetary Policy 
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) conducts national monetary policy in the United States. Regularly scheduled FOMC meetings conclude with a vote on the stance of monetary policy—including a decision about whether the FOMC will adjust the target range for the federal funds rate.

The federal funds rate is the Fed’s policy rate, which means it is the rate the Fed chooses to target to achieve its policy goals—the dual mandate. The FOMC sets the target range for the federal funds rate with the upper and lower limits on the range, which have been consistently 0.25 percentage points apart.

The committee issues a press release and the chair of the FOMC holds a press conference directly after each meeting to explain the decision to either increase/decrease the federal funds target range or leave the federal funds target range unchanged.

### Gathering Data for Monetary Policy Analysis
Research economists at all 12 Federal Reserve Banks, as well as at the Board of Governors, contribute to the policymaking process. Generally speaking, economists at Reserve Banks monitor economic conditions in their Districts and the nation. The primary duty of the economists is to help prepare their Reserve Bank president for his or her participation in FOMC meetings.

Before each FOMC meeting, for example, researchers survey key industry contacts within their Districts and assemble a report called the Beige Book, which can often highlight meaningful trends in economic activity before they show up in national statistics. The Beige Book serves as an up-to-the-minute resource for FOMC discussions and its contents are widely reported in the press.

The loans and deposit data that Reserve Banks collect from **depository institutions** are some of the most critical statistics the Fed gathers. Such information is used in analyzing regional and national bank performance, credit demand, and other banking concerns.

Federal Reserve economists use data to forecast potential outcomes of various economic scenarios. All the while, the economists look for key information that will contribute to better monetary policy. The variety of research interests around the Federal Reserve System fosters a diversity of views and influences wider economic thought.

Besides producing publications for audiences of all kinds, Fed speakers address numerous groups on the economic outlook, participate in professional forums, conduct educational seminars for area teachers, provide economic information for local reporters, develop publications about the economy and the Fed for the public, and develop lessons and online tools about the economy for use in classrooms.

### Supervision and Regulation
Bank **regulation** refers to the written rules that define acceptable behavior and conduct for financial institutions. The Board of Governors, along with other bank regulatory agencies, carries out this responsibility.

Bank **supervision** refers to the enforcement of these rules. The 12 Reserve Banks carry out this responsibility, supervising state-chartered member banks, the companies that own banks and thrifts, international organizations that conduct banking business in the United States, and some companies that are not banks at all, but nevertheless are important to the financial system. In addition to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also supervise financial institutions. 

In the past, Reserve Bank examiners reviewed each bank in much the same way—looking over the bank's books on-site and evaluating the quality of its assets and its ability to cover loan losses. Today, Fed examinations are more customized for each bank. Examinations take into account that each bank differs markedly in its services and products and that a bank's own management should be held responsible for monitoring the institution's exposure to risks.

By studying the bank's risk-management procedures and internal controls, Reserve Bank examiners assess whether a bank lends money wisely and can manage the level of loans it makes to customers. Examiners also review a bank's performance in complying with its own internal policies, as well as with federal and state laws and regulations.

At the end of an on-site review, Fed examiners issue the bank a rating that reflects the institution's condition. The rating indicates whether the institution is sound enough to withstand fluctuations in the economy or whether it has weaknesses that require correction. Between examinations, Reserve Banks monitor financial institutions by examining bank reports filed with the Fed.

### Federal Reserve Consumer Protection
Fed examiners not only ensure that credit costs and interest rates are stated accurately, but also, they make sure they are stated clearly. For example, borrowers must not only be told the interest rate, but they must also be told the annual percentage rate (APR), fees, terms, and conditions for a loan. In addition, home mortgage loans are examined to be certain that banks are charging reasonable interest rates and lending to people who can afford to pay back the loans.

Fed examiners specially trained in consumer protection regulations examine banks for compliance with laws written to ensure that they treat consumers fairly. For example, the Fed enforces fair lending regulations, which require that loan applications be judged based on the consumer's ability to repay the loan and not on the consumer's race, gender, age, neighborhood of residence, or other discriminatory practice.

The Fed also regulates banks’ issuance of debit cards. Consumers use debit cards to make purchases in lieu of using cash or checks; the purchase amount is deducted immediately from the card holder's bank account. Fed examiners ensure that these transactions are conducted fairly, fees are appropriate, and errors are resolved in a timely manner. As with examinations of loans, Fed examiners also ensure that all fees and other features of consumers’ bank accounts are stated accurately and clearly.

### Federal Reserve Discount Window Lending
One of the most important ways that the Federal Reserve provides liquidity to the banking system is by offering funds for loans through its discount window.

### Federal Reserve Independence and Accountability
Most nations in the developed world today have an independent central bank. International studies have consistently shown that central banks with a higher degree of independence are more effective at maintaining stable price levels. 

Under the law, the Federal Reserve was made accountable to Congress but also was specifically designed to carry out its responsibilities without interference or control from the vested interests inherent in electoral politics, fiscal policymaking, and private banking. In short, the Fed was created as an independent central bank. Of course, there are limits to the Fed’s independence, and independence does not imply that the Fed is not accountable. 

Examples of Fed Independence:
* Federal Reserve officials cannot be fired simply because the president or a member of Congress disagrees with Federal Reserve decisions about interest rates.
* Similarly, although commercial bankers serve as members of Federal Reserve Banks' boards of directors, they do not establish banking regulations.
* The Board of Governors is nominated by the president of the United States and must be confirmed by the Senate.

Examples of Fed Accountability:
* The Federal Reserve's policy goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment are specified by Congress, and Fed officials report regularly to Congress on progress toward meeting those goals.
* The chair of the Board of Governors must give regular reports to Congress.
* The minutes of FOMC meetings are released to the public after a short time lag.
* The president of each Federal Reserve Bank is chosen by a local board of directors, but the selection must be approved by the Board of Governors.
* Each Federal Reserve Bank is audited every year by independent auditors.
* The budget of each Federal Reserve Bank must be approved by the Board of Governors.
