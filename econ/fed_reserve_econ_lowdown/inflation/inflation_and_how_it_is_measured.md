# Inflation is Real
Inflation is a general, sustained upward movement of prices for goods and services in an economy. It affects purchasing power or the amount of goods and services that a unit of currency can buy; more specifically, inflation reduces purchasing power. Data show the changing value of the dollar and its purchasing power.

# Inflation Types
One type of inflation is *cost-push inflation*. This occurs when the costs of production (including wages and raw materials) increase and those higher costs are passed on to consumers. For example, if the minimum wage increases from $9 an hour to $15 an hour, firms may raise prices of their products because of the higher cost of wages. If firms raise prices, consumers will pay more.

Inflation also occurs when the overall quantity of goods and services demanded by consumers exceeds the overall quantity of goods and services supplied by producers. This is called demand-pull inflation, and it occurs when consumers have more money and want to spend it. This is often referred to as “too much money chasing too few goods" or _demand-pull inflation_. In this case, spending increases at a rate that outpaces production and usually occurs in an expanding economy.

# What's Not Inflation
Prices tend to rise over time. But [increases in the price of a single good or service](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2024/03/01/the-inflation-rate-is-falling-but-prices-are-not), or even a few goods or services, do not indicate that the economy is experiencing inflation.

Technological improvements and more competition in the marketplace for specific items can also affect prices. In these instances, the price of some individual goods and services may remain the same or even decrease in price over time. For example, the price of a computer is much less today than 20 years ago. Some of this is an actual decrease in price, but part of the decrease is due to quality adjustment. For example, imagine a computer model that is the same price in year 1 and year 2, but the year 2 version of the computer has a faster processor and larger hard drive. In reality you are getting more computer for the same amount of money; in [“real” (inflation adjusted) terms](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2023/01/03/adjusting-for-inflation), the price of the computer has decreased from year 1 to year 2, even if the price you pay at the cash register is exactly the same.

# Measuring Inflation
Inflation is the increase in the average price of many goods and services, and the most widely reported measure of inflation is the consumer price index, or CPI. The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Urban consumers represent about 93 percent of the total U.S. population.

The CPI does not measure inflation for people living in rural areas, serving in the Armed Forces, or living in institutions. Since 1913, a federal agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has gathered this information by contacting businesses to collect and record the prices of items. The BLS releases this information monthly, and researchers can use the data to compare the prices of goods and services in a month, in a quarter, or over a span of years.

# The Market Basket
Although the CPI does not literally include all items, it is quite representative of the goods and services consumers buy on a regular basis. It includes a market basket of about 80,000 items that are sorted into more than 200 categories and arranged into eight major groups.

## Eight Major Groups in CPI Market Basket
1. Food and beverages
2. Medical care
3. Housing
4. Recreation
5. Apparel
6. Education and communication
7. Transportation
8. Other goods and services

Some items are weighted more heavily than others. For example, housing makes up a significant part of consumers' budgets, so it is weighted more heavily. CPI includes some taxes, such as sales and excise taxes, that are directly associated with the prices of specific goods and services. However, the CPI excludes other taxes, such as income and Social Security taxes, because they are not directly associated with the purchase of consumer goods and services. Financial products like stocks and bonds are not included in the market basket. Essentially, the market basket attempts to represent the goods and services purchased by the population represented by the CPI.

# The Inflation Rate
The inflation rate is the percentage increase in the average price level of goods and services over a period of time. To figure the rate, the BLS sets the price of the market basket during a particular time period equal to “100” and calculates the increase in the price of goods in another time. For example, if the value in year 1 is 100 and it rises to 103 in year 2, the percentage increase in the price of goods and services from year 1 to year 2 is equal to a 3 percent annual inflation rate. A 3 percent annual inflation rate means that, on average, a dollar buys 3 percent fewer goods and services than it did the year before.

**Annual CPI Inflation Rate Formula**

```math
\frac{\text{CPI later year - CPI earlier year}}{\text{CPI earlier year}} * 100
```

# CPI versus Core CPI
Core CPI is the CPI excluding food and energy. Core CPI removes food and energy from the market basket because these price categories are more subject to frequent and sudden changes. For example, weather events may disrupt crops, or fluctuations in oil supply can impact fuel prices. Looking at the core inflation rate can make it easier to see the long-term, underlying trends in other categories. In other words, by examining core inflation, economists can analyze what is happening to general prices without being distracted by sudden changes in food and energy prices.

# Inflation and Personal Finance
Inflation affects consumers in different ways. As long as personal incomes increase at the same rate as the inflation rate, purchasing power remains constant and inflation is hardly noticeable. However, if consumers' personal income does not increase, or it increases at a slower rate than the inflation rate, consumers aren't able to buy the same amount of goods and services as they could previously. This reduces purchasing power and is an important factor in making a budget. Inflation also reduces the value of people's savings if the interest rate at which their savings grows is less than the rate of inflation. For example, if a savings account is paying 1 percent annual interest and the inflation rate is 2 percent, the purchasing power of the money in that savings account is reduced by 1 percent.

Inflation is the average increase in prices for the typical urban consumer, but few people are exactly “typical”. Individual consumers experience inflation differently because they buy different items. The price of some items may increase more rapidly than the price of others.

As “prices go up,” consumers experience the obvious effects of inflation and learn to make adjustments in their budgets. But consumers are more sensitive to changes in price than to changes in quantity, and this tendency allows companies to benefit from shrinkflation. For example, companies might reduce the size or quantity of their products without reducing the price. Shoppers can easily find downsized product packing in grocery store aisles. For example, what used to be a 1 pound package of bacon may look the same and cost the same, but it may have been downsized to only 12 ounces. Or a box of cereal that used to be 18 ounces may have been downsized to 16 ounces. Shrinkflation is inflation that can go unnoticed, but it's real.

# The Fed and Inflation
Inflation is a concern to the Federal Reserve (Fed), the central bank of the United States. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate—the responsibility to promote maximum employment and price stability. Price stability means maintaining a low and stable rate of inflation. To meet its price stability goal, the Fed seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. Sometimes inflation may be a bit above 2 percent, while at other times it may be a bit below 2 percent; but, on average, it should be 2 percent. Economists generally agree that a low and stable inflation rate creates economic conditions that encourage economic growth and employment.

When the inflation rate is less than 2 percent, the danger of **deflation** exists. Falling prices and deflation can signal a weak economic condition. An inflation rate greater than zero maintains an “inflation buffer”—that is, some “wiggle room”—which reduces the chances of deflation should the economy start to weaken. Fed policymakers see a 2 percent inflation target as a compromise—high enough to provide a buffer against deflation while low enough to minimize the distortions that arise from high inflation.
