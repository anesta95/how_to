# Inflation's Effects on Consumers
Inflation affects consumers' **budgets** and spending decisions. If consumers' personal **incomes** do not increase, or they increase at a slower rate than the inflation rate, then [consumers aren't able to buy the same amount of goods and services](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2024/03/01/the-inflation-rate-is-falling-but-prices-are-not) they could previously. When consumers are faced with spending more to get the same amount of goods and services, they may purchase fewer items or substitute less-expensive goods and services.

# Inflation's Effects on Businesses
Inflation also affects businesses. Businesses understand the reality of inflation when the **costs of production** increase and they must adjust to continue to earn a **profit**. Often businesses pass the higher costs of production on to consumers through higher prices. When this leads to inflation, it is referred to as **cost-push inflation**. For example, if the cost of transporting lettuce from California to Maine increases because fuel prices have increased, and the seller believes they can pass the extra cost along to the buyer, then the price consumers pay for lettuce at the grocery store will increase.

# Business Reactions to Inflation
Businesses can raise prices to remain profitable when production costs increase. But they know that consumers are very conscious of price changes and may choose to buy a cheaper brand or stop buying the item completely. Businesses do not want to lose sales.

# Shrinkflation
How can businesses cope with inflation and their desire to keep their customers? Businesses know that for some goods and services, consumers are more sensitive to changes in price than to changes in quantity, and this tendency often allows businesses to benefit from shrinkflation.

Originally known as downsizing, the term shrinkflation comes from the combination of the two words shrink and inflation. Shrinkflation is when businesses reduce the size or quantity of their products while charging the same or an even higher price. For example:

* A package of bacon may look the same and sell for the same price, but instead of being 16 ounces it is only 12 ounces.
* Similarly, a box of cereal that used to contain 18 ounces may look the same but contain only 16 ounces of cereal.
* Or, a box of tissues may have fewer tissues than before when sold at the same price.

The BLS treats shrinkflation as a price increase when calculating inflation numbers. It makes adjustments for changes in the size or quantity of a packaged item to ensure consumers can accurately compare prices despite the changes in size or quantity.

Although inflation numbers take shrinkflation into account, consumers have the responsibility to notice the changes in the size or quantity of a packaged item. Consumers can easily find examples of shrinkflation at the grocery store (table).

Shrinkflation varies by product and brand, which means it's important for consumers to compare products and prices in order to make wise spending decisions. Con­­sumers can compare product prices by considering unit prices. A unit price changes when the ounces, pounds, or quantity of a product changes but its price remains the same or increases.

For example, if a roll of paper towels is priced at $3 and has 165 sheets per roll, the unit price is $0.018 per sheet. If the package is downsized to only 147 sheets and the price remains the same, the unit price increases to $0.02 per sheet. In this instance, buying the downsized product means getting less product for the same money.

## Is Shrinkflation Legal?
In 1967, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) was enacted to ensure that consumers had enough information to make an informed choice between competing products. The Act requires each package of household "consumer commodities" included in the FPLA's coverage to have a label that includes the net quantity of contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count (measurement must be in both metric and inch/pound units).10

The FPLA also states that "Packages and their labels should enable consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents and should facilitate value comparisons." So, shrinkflation is legal—if businesses clearly mark their products with an accurate weight that allows consumers to compare prices.

# Skimpflation
Instead of increasing prices, businesses might decide to do something called skimpflation. Skimpflation is defined as businesses "skimping" on the quality of a product or service. Businesses skimp by spending less on services or materials to remain profitable.

Skimpflation means skimping on service by cutting costs. For example, hotels may make changes in their housekeeping services. Instead of workers cleaning guest rooms daily, their service may be reduced to every other day or when a guest checks out. This change reduces labor costs.

There can be skimping on quality, too. Those hot, complimentary hotel breakfast buffets that include fresh fruit, waffles, eggs, and bacon may be replaced by prepackaged sweet rolls and cereal. Replacing more-expensive foods with cheaper foods is a way to cut costs.

And businesses may change their formulas for food products to use cheaper ingredients in these products. For example, artificial sweeteners and cheaper oils may be substituted for more expensive ingredients. Unless consumers compare the ingredients label from an older product with the new one, they won't be aware of the change when making a purchase. But businesses take a risk when switching a formula to use cheaper ingredients. If the change is noticeable to consumers and they don't like the change in taste, they may stop buying the product.

Consumers may notice a change in a food's taste, but skimping on quality is harder to detect in some other products. For example, toilet tissue may be packaged the same and have the same number of sheets per roll, but it may have thinner sheets. Looking at the package, a consumer wouldn't know of that change in quality.
