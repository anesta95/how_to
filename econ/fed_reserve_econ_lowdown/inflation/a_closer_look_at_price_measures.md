# Inflation Is an Increase in an Economy’s Price Level
**Inflation** is an increase in the price level, or average level of prices, of goods and services. The **price level** can either increase or decrease. When an economy’s price level increases, we call it inflation; when it decreases, we call it **deflation**.

The figure below displays the average level of prices in the United States over the past five decades, as measured by the **consumer price index (CPI)**—that is, a market basket of about 80,000 household goods and services that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks the prices of over time. As you can see, in most years, the price level is rising.

# The Inflation Rate Tells You How Quickly the Price Level is Rising
The **inflation rate** is just that, the rate at which the price level is rising. So, the inflation rate might be higher, such as 8%, or it might be lower, such as 2%. But in both cases the price level is increasing; one rate of increase is simply higher than the other. When the inflation rate falls, say from 8% to 4%, we call it **disinflation**, meaning the price level is rising at a slower rate.

So, any positive inflation rate number means inflation is occurring and the price level is rising. It’s not until the inflation rate becomes negative that deflation is occurring.

# Inflation Is an Increase in the Average Level of Prices, not all Prices
Finally, it’s important to note that not all prices necessarily increase when there is inflation. Recall that inflation is an increase in the average level of prices. If the price level is increasing, the prices of many of the items counted in the CPI are increasing—but not all of them. Some prices are surely decreasing, and some prices are staying the same. The price level has increased, but not the price of every single good or service in the CPI basket or the economy.
