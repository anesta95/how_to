# Real versus Nominal GDP

GDP measured using current prices is called **nominal GDP**. When GDP is computed using current prices, price changes make it difficult to determine how much the change in GDP from one year to the next is due to those price changes and how much is the result of a change in production of goods and services. When GDP is adjusted for price changes, it is called **real GDP**. In economics, the word "real" means that we have adjusted for inflation and that figures are measured in constant prices, that is, in prices of a given or base period.

**Nominal gross domestic product (GDP)**
The total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year expressed using the current year's price for goods and services. Also known as current-dollar GDP.

**Real gross domestic product (GDP)**
The total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year calculated by using a base year's price for goods and services; nominal GDP adjusted for inflation.

# Levels of GDP versus Percentage Change in GDP
To determine whether the economy is healthy and growing, and at what rate the economy is growing, economists must compare the percentage change in real GDP numbers over time.

Percentage change is calculated either by the "NOO" method: subtracting the old number from the new number and dividing by the old number `(New - Old) / Old` and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Or just simply dividing the new number by the older number and subtracing one `(New / Old) - 1` and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. 

Economic growth is defined as an increase in real GDP over a period of time. It isn't the absolute change in GDP that tells us what we need to know. We have to determine how fast or how slowly the economy is growing by measuring the rate of change — the percentage change in real GDP over a period of time.

# The Importance of a Growing Economy

**A growing economy helps keep pace with a growing population.**
To maintain the current standard of living—that is, the amount of goods and services available to each person in a society—the economy must grow at least as fast as the population is growing. Standard of living is measured as real GDP per capita—that is, a country's real GDP divided by the country's population. If the population is growing, and real GDP doesn't grow, the society's standard of living will decline. To improve its standard of living, a society's real GDP must grow faster than its population is growing.

**A growing economy puts a country in a position to meet new needs and resolve socioeconomic problems.**
As economies develop, citizens expect more goods and services per capita—that is, an increase in income per capita. For example, in a more-developed economy, citizens may expect air and water to be clean. They probably want a larger variety and quantity of goods and services. To provide more goods and services for the same-size population, the economy must grow. Of course, this is equivalent to saying there must be more income per capita.

# Trend Growth Rate
In economics, a trend is the long-term movement of an economic measure, such as real GDP. To determine such a trend, economists look at the measure's average rate of increase or decrease over a long period of time. In the case of real GDP for the United States, the trend growth rate of real GDP is about 3% annually. The economy can grow at trend—meaning around 3%. It can also grow above and/or below trend.

**Potential output** is an estimate of what an economy could feasibly produce when it fully employs its available economic resources. Potential GDP — as defined by the CBO — is the economy's maximum sustainable output. Economists sometimes refer to the economy's *potential growth rate* as its *trend growth rate*.

At any given time there might be a difference between *actual* output and *potential* output. The difference between actual output and potential output is called the *output gap*. The short-run fluctuations of actual output around potential output determine the **business cycle**. The business cycle is the fluctuating levels of economic activity in an economy over a period of time measured from the beginning of one recession to the beginning of the next.

Knowing the economy's potential growth rate, or trend growth, is important because policymakers consider the output gap when determining whether the economy needs more or less stimulus. When the economy is experiencing a negative output gap — meaning the GDP growth rate is below its trend rate — the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is likely to lower it's target range for the federal funds rate to lower interest rates and ease financial conditions for consumers and businesses. The goal of this action is to keep the economy growing as close to trend as possible.
