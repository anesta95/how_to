# Uses for GDP Data

Policymakers include federal, state and local government decisionmakers who make taxing and spending decisions—fiscal policy—and the Federal Reserve, which makes decisions about the money supply—monetary policy. Fiscal and monetary policymakers have the ability to affect economic growth in order to attempt to keep the economy on its trend growth rate over time.

# Automatic Stabilizers
An automatic stabilizer is a standing policy that activates automatically without intervention, usually during a recession. **Automatic stabilizers** are provisions in a government's budget, such as tax policies and income transfer programs, that help stabilize economic growth. These provisions cause government spending to rise or taxes to fall automatically — without legislation — when GDP falls. When GDP rises, these provisions cause government spending to fall or taxes to rise without direct legislative action.

Unemployment insurance is a good example of an automatic stabilizer. When an economy goes into a recession and unemployment rises, more people are eligible for unemployment insurance payments. These are paid automatically without action by Congress. Another example of an automatic stabilizer is the income tax system. When the economy goes into a recession, incomes fall and less income tax is paid. This stabilizer helps cushion the decrease in disposable income.
