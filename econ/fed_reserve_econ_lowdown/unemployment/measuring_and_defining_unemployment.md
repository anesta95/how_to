# How is Unemployment Measured?
In its monthly reports, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides the current unemployment rate, the change in the unemployment rate from the previous period, and a variety of other statistics and information. To generate these data, the BLS conducts the current population survey (CPS), which is a household survey used to measure the extent of unemployment. About 60,000 households are surveyed and selected to collectively represent the entire population of the country. Members of these selected households are interviewed in person, by phone, and via computer.

Each interviewee is asked questions pertaining to his/her employment status, then classified as either in or out of the labor force. Those out of the labor force are those who have not actively looked for a job in the past four weeks. Those in the labor force are then classified as either employed or unemployed. A household is interviewed for four consecutive months then removed from the survey for the next eight months. After that time, the household is included again for four more consecutive months before being replaced with a new household. This method provides the BLS with information not only on the number of people unemployed, but also on the length of time people are unemployed.

# How Unemployment is Defined
## A look at the Labor Force
Let's take a closer look at what it means to be unemployed. There's more to it than simply not having a job! Understanding who makes up the labor force is key. The labor force is composed of people working and people not working but looking for work. 

People not counted as part of the labor force are those that are not seeking work; for example, retirees, school kids, people who stay home to care for family members, and those unable to work because of a disability. So, for example, in a country where 4,000,000 people are classified as working and 250,000 as looking for work, the labor force totals 4,250,000. 

The people who aren't working but are still looking for work are represented by the unemployment rate. So, the unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that's not currently working.

The following calculation determines the unemployment rate:
```math
\frac{\text{number of unemployed}}{\text{total labor force}} = unemployment\:rate
```

# Who Are the Unemployed?
The unemployed are people not working but looking for work. There's also a little more to the classification. To be classified as unemployed, a person must be

* 16 years of age or older;
* not confined to an institution, such as a nursing home or a mental or correctional facility; and
* not employed at any time during the week the Current Population Survey is taken.

# What Does the BLS Report about Employment and Unemployment?
Employment is reported in two forms, "seasonally adjusted" and "not seasonally adjusted"? 

Some jobs are seasonal. For example, there are more construction-related jobs in the spring, summer and fall. In late fall and winter, there are more jobs in retail (think holiday shopping). Although these fluctuations are normal, they can make changes in employment look better or worse than is actually the case.

In seasonally adjusted data, the predictable fluctuations are removed so other trends will be more visible. If, for example, employment increased in December, without seasonal adjustment it would be difficult to know how much of the increase was from normal seasonal hiring and how much was from new job creation beyond the normal seasonal trend.

# Types of Unemployment
There are three types of unemployment. The three are similar in that each represents a jobless situation; however, each occurs for a different reason.

**Frictional unemployment** 
Unemployment that results when people are new to the job market (for example, recent graduates) or are transitioning from one job to another. Frictional unemployment occurs when jobs requiring certain skills are available and people with those skills are available, but the two have not matched up yet. It can be thought of as the time between jobs. Frictional unemployment is often temporary and often benefits both the job seeker and the employer in the end.

**Structural unemployment**
Long-term joblessness caused by a mismatch in the skills held by those looking for work and the skills demanded by those seeking workers .Structural unemployment occurs when a job requiring a specific skill set is no longer needed, either in a specific industry, geographic area, or both. Many factors can contribute to this type of unemployment, including technological advances.


**Cyclical unemployment** 
Unemployment associated with recessions in the business cycle. Cyclical unemployment occurs when there is a downward cycle in the economy. When the economy contracts, the demand for goods and services decreases and people lose their jobs. When the economy begins to grow again and the demand for goods and services increases, people regain employment.

## Frictional Unemployment
Frictional unemployment occurs as a normal part of a healthy economy. It includes people graduating from school and trying to find a job. It also includes people quitting one job to find a better fit for their skills or lifestyle.

In short, frictional unemployment occurs because there are always workers between jobs. It sometimes takes a while for workers seeking a job to find the right fit.

Frictional unemployment can eventually be good for the economy. Matching those searching for jobs with employers searching for workers takes time, but it’s actually good for the economy. The process allows people to work in jobs that fully utilize their skills.


## Structural Unemployment
A much more serious type of unemployment can occur when people are looking for jobs and firms are looking for workers, but the people's skills don't match those the firms need. In other words, job-seekers' skills have become obsolete either in a given industry, geographic area, or both. This is known as structural unemployment.

This type of unemployment is a natural by-product of advances in technology. Industries — and the skills needed to run them — change.

Frictional unemployment and structural unemployment normally occur in a dynamic economy. After all, industries and skill requirements constantly change. To some degree, you might even think of these types of unemployment as voluntary. After all, a frictionally unemployed person could be employed but chooses to search for something better. And a structurally unemployed person, such as an unemployed auto worker, could likely find a job at a local cleaners or gas station, but not in the pay range he has enjoyed. So, he voluntarily remains unemployed.

## Cyclical
Cyclical unemployment is so named because it reflects the cycles in the economy. The cycles in the economy are referred to as business cycles.

While the economy is moving forward, it is employing a lot of people to produce a lot of goods and services. The more people work, the more money they earn. The more money they earn, the more goods and services they demand. The more goods and services are demanded, the more people are put to work. This is called an expansion, and the workforce puts forth more and more energy as the expansion continues.

Eventually, the economy hits its peak and begins a period of decline, a contraction. Fewer goods and services are demanded, so workers lose their jobs. At first, this is barely noticeable in the economy, much like the slow pace as you begin your decent. However, as people lose their jobs, they demand fewer goods and services, which creates even more layoffs, which creates even less demand, and so on.

There are policies in place, such as unemployment insurance, that apply the brakes to the downward momentum in the economy. Eventually, in small steps, people begin to demand goods and services again. Workers return to jobs. The economic contraction flattens.

# Will Unemployment Ever Be Zero?
Now that you've learned about the types of unemployment, think about this: Can we ever have 100% employment? The answer is no. There are always people frictionally and structurally unemployed. There will always be people looking for that better job opportunity, and there will always be technology changes that cause some skills to become obsolete while creating opportunities for new skills.
